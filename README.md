I will be sharing resource codes for Machine Learning, Deep Learning, and NLP, covering topics like ANN, CNN, image classification, dropout regularization, and NLP comparisons (NLTK vs. SpaCy). These notebooks will include TensorFlow and Keras-based implementations for tasks like digit recognition and visualization using TensorBoard. In the future, I will keep adding more detailed explanations, optimizations, and new techniques to enhance learning.
